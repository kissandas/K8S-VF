Its time for Assignment :)

1. Create a image for nginx server with some static content in it.
2. Build image.
3. Push image on docker hub.
4. Run this image on k8s cluster with 3 replicas (hint deployment) so that we can change that static content from our host machine (hint volumes) 
5. Access this app from your browser (hint services and its types).
6. Login through ssh to server where pod is running and change the content without making website down.
7. Update source content and rebuild image with version 2 and perform rolling update.
